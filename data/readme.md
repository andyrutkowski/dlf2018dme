The following data files should be contained in this folder:

# CSV
There are two csv files. Both of these files were created by Jose Cardona, student researcher at  UCLA, in consultation with Professor Genevieve Carpio (UCLA) and Andy Rutkowski (UCLA at the time of creation and now at USC) during the spring/summer of 2017. Addresses were hand coded into a Google spreadsheet, geocoded using a script (see below), and then verified using current Google Maps in order to make sure that locations were accurate.

* 39GreenBook.csv - Los Angeles locations from the 1939 Greenbook. 
* 47GreenBook.csv - Los Angeles locations from the 1939 Greenbook

# Geojson



# .GS 

This .gs file is a google script that lets you geocode addressed in Google Sheets. 

* geocodingmacroforgooglesheets.gs

The orginal script and instructions can be found here:
